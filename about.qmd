ViruScan is an application designed to perform contact tracing for respiratory viruses, including COVID-19, flu, RSV, and rhinovirus, at UGA. It is the first app of its kind to do so for multiple respiratory viruses. It utilizes GPS-location tracking and Bluetooth technology to determine participant’s potential contacts. All notifications of exposure are anonymous. Contacts receive information regarding testing. Participants can report cases through the ViruScan module within the UGA Safe App.

ViruScan was created for a course project (EPID 8110 at UGA). Therefore, this website is simply a mock-up demonstrating what a public-facing dashboard for ViruScan would look like. All data utilized to develop graphs and tables were made-up for the purpose of the mock-up.
