Immunizations help boost the body's **adaptive immune system**, which memorizes pathogens that the body has come into contact with. This enables a more rapid response during subsequent exposures. 

Vaccines **reduce** the likelihood of **contracting an illness**, while also **preventing severe illness and death**.¹
