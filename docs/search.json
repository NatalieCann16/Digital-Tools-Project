    "text": "ViruScan is an application designed to perform contact tracing for respiratory viruses, including COVID-19, flu, RSV, and rhinovirus, at UGA. It is the first app of its kind to do so for multiple respiratory viruses. It utilizes GPS-location tracking and Bluetooth technology to determine participant’s potential contacts. All notifications of exposure are anonymous. Contacts receive information regarding testing. Participants can report cases through the ViruScan module within the UGA Safe App.\nViruScan was created for a course project (EPID 8110 at UGA). Therefore, this website is simply a mock-up demonstrating what a public-facing dashboard for ViruScan would look like. All data utilized to develop graphs and tables were made-up for the purpose of the mock-up.\n\nWatch our Short Video about ViruScan\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is ViruScan?\n\n\nViruScan is a respiratory virus contact tracing app for students and faculty at the University of Georgia.\nRespiratory viruses, such as COVID-19, Influenza, Rhinovirus (the common cold), and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), are a great public health concern on college campuses, including the University of Georgia’s.\nAccording to Nichols et al., it has been estimated that roughly 91% of university students contract at least one upper respiratory infection each academic year.\nViruScan’s aim is to reduce transmission of respiratory viral infections by digitizing contact tracing.\n\n\n\n\nHow does ViruScan work?\n\n\nEligible participants download ViruScan and consent for their location to be tracked via GPS.\nBluetooth technology is used to determine contacts between ViruScan users.\nWhen a user comes into contact with someone who has been diagnosed with a case of a respiratory virus, they will receive a de-identified notification of exposure to a specific illness.\nTesting information will be shared alongside the notification.\n\n\n\n\nWho is eligible to download ViruScan?\n\n\nFaculty, staff, & students of the University of Georgia are eligible to participate in contact tracing via ViruScan.\nStudents must be 18 years or older and must reside in Athens, GA, or commute to Athens.\nIn order to participate in contact-tracing, one must enable UGA Safe & ViruScan to track their location.\n\n\n\n\nIs my data private?\n\n\nYes, all data collected through ViruScan is private and secure.\n\nYour GPS data is encrypted and stored on a university server.\nYour GPS data is deleted 30 days after it is recorded.\nYour location will only be tracked in order to determine potential exposures.\n\nNotifications of exposure will always be de-identified in order to protect the privacy of those who are cases, while also informing those who came into contact with cases.\nTo login to ViruScan, one must use their UGA MyID credentials.\n\n\n\n\nHow to download and access ViruScan?\n\n\n\nSearch ‘UGA Safe’ in your smartphone’s app store.\n\n\nDownload onto your phone and then login using your UGA MyID credentials.\n\n\nClick on ViruScan within the UGA Safe app and follow in-app set-up instructions. ViruScan will appear on UGA Safe’s homepage.\n\n\nEnable ViruScan to track your location so it can determine your recent contacts. You can do this in the settings for UGA Safe."
